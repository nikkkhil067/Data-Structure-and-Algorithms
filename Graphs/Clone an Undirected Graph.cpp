/*
The idea is to do a BFS traversal of the graph and while visiting a node make a clone node of it(a copy of original node).
  If a node is encountered which is already visited then it already has a clone node.

How to keep track of the visited/cloned nodes?
A HashMap/Map is required in order to maintain all the nodes which have already been created.
Key stores: Reference/Address of original Node
Value stores: Reference/Address of cloned Node

A copy of all the graph nodes has been made, how to connect clone nodes?
While visiting the neighboring vertices of a node u get the corresponding cloned node for u , 
letâ€™s call that cloneNodeU , now visit all the neighboring nodes for u and for each neighbor 
    find the corresponding clone node(if not found create one) and 
    then push into the neighboring vector of cloneNodeU node.

How to verify if the cloned graph is a correct?
Do a BFS traversal before and after the cloning of graph. 
In BFS traversal display the value of a node along with its address/reference.
Compare the order in which nodes are displayed,
    if the values are same but the address/reference is different for both the traversals 
    than the cloned graph is correct.
