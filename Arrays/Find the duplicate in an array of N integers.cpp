//Find the repeating elements in a given array
/*
Approach:The elements in the array is from 0 to n-1 and all of them are positive.
So to find out the duplicate elements, a HashMap is required, but the question is to solve the problem in constant space. 
There is a catch, the array is of length n and the elements are from 0 to n-1 (n elements). The array can be used as a HashMap.

Algorithm:
Traverse the array from start to end.
For every element,take its absolute value and if the abs(array[i])â€˜th element is positive, the element has not encountered before,
else if negative the element has been encountered before print the absolute value of the current element.
